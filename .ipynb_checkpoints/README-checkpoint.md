We analyzed the results of 10 cancer treatment drugs on the tumor volume in 248 mice over the course of 45 days.  

We included the results of all mice except one, who had duplicate measurements that conflicted with one another.  

In these results, you can find a statistical analysis of the effects of each drug on tumor size, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of mean.

Next you will see a bar chart showing how many measurements were used in the analysis for each drug, showing Capomulin and Ramicane (approximately 250) with the most measurements and Propriva with the fewest (approximately 150).  

After that, a pie chart shows that the number of male mice and female mice in the study was essentially equal (male = 51%, female = 49%).

Finally, you will see an box plot analysis of the final tumor volumes for the mice in 4 of the drug treatment groups, including Capomulin and Ramicane, which shows significantly smaller tumor volumes at the end of treatment with outliers for Infubinol showing in the same range as the two top drugs.
